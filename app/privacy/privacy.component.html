                            analyze which charging stations
                            are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, where additional charging
                            stations are needed, and in

                            identifiable images or short video clips using the car’s external cameras to learn how to

                            for clips associated with a
                            specific car. Separately, if you agree to allow us to collect video clips, Sentry Mode will
                            send recorded video clips
                            linked to your VIN to Vixon for temporary backup. We may also use these clips to help

                            Vixon provides notice of our data practices in this Privacy Notice. This includes what
                            personal data is collected, the
                            source of the personal data, and the purposes of use, as well as whether Vixon discloses
                            that personal data and if so,
                            the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed. California residents who have

                            If you do not have a Vixon account, Vixon may ask you for information which we consider
                            necessary to verify your
                            identity for security and to prevent fraud. This information may include name, contact
                            information, and information
                            related to your transaction or relationship with Vixon, but the specific information
                            requested may differ depending on
                            the circumstances of your request for your security and to protect privacy rights. If you
                            request deletion of your
                            personal data, please note, that we will both render certain personal data about you
                            permanently unrecoverable and also
                            de-identify certain personal data. <br /><br />

                            <br /><br />
                            We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect
                            information within our
                            organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be
                            100% secure. If you have
                            reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you
                            feel that the security of any
                            account with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by
                            contacting us in accordance with
                            the “How to contact us” section below. <br /><br />

                            Additionally, if you sell or transfer your Vixon product to another person, please notify us
                            so that we can determine
                            whether additional steps are required to help safeguard information from or about you from
                            disclosure to the purchaser
                            or transferee of the Vixon product. <br /><br />

                            This Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or
                            other practices of any third
                            parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which our Digital

                            link on our Digital Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us
                            or by our affiliates, nor
                            does it imply an affiliation with the third party. <br /><br />

                            Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure policies and
                            practices (including the

                            <br /><br />
                            Our products and services are controlled and operated from the United States. Information
                            from or about you or your use
                            of our products or services may be stored and processed in any country where we have
                            facilities or in which we engage
                            service providers. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country
                            in which you initially
                            provided that information. When we transfer information from or about you or your use of our
                            products or services to
                            other countries, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. By using our
                            products or services, or otherwise
                            providing information to us, you consent to the transfer of information from or about you or
                            your use of our products or
                            services to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States.
                            <br /><br />

                            If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), or
                            Switzerland, we comply with
                            applicable legal requirements for the transfer of personal information to countries outside
                            of the EEA, the UK, or
                            Switzerland. In particular, Vixon has certified its adherence to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
                            Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
                            Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce and the European
                            Commission, and the Swiss Federal
                            Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, with respect to the processing
                            of certain personal
                            information transferred from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland to Vixon and its wholly-owned
                            U.S. subsidiaries. Vixon’s
                            Privacy Shield Policy is available below. In addition, Vixon has entered into Standard
                            Contractual Clauses issued by the
                            European Commission where appropriate. <br /><br />

                            We may rely on various legal grounds to collect, use, and otherwise process your
                            information, including: your consent;
                            that the information is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; to comply with
                            a legal obligation; to
                            protect your, or someone else’s vital interests; or for a legitimate interest that is
                            balanced against your rights and
                            interests. These legitimate interests may include Vixon’s interest in improving its products
                            and services, enhancing
                            safety and security, protecting Vixon or its business partners against wrongful conduct, and
                            responding to customer
                            inquiries and claims. Where applicable, we will inform you whether and why we need certain
                            information from you, for
                            example, whether we need the information to fulfill a legal or contractual requirement and
                            what the consequences are of
                            not providing the information. <br /><br />

                            If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, Vixon International B.V. is responsible
                            for processing your personal
